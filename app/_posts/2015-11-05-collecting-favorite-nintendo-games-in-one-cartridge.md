## Intro

I love retro video games and the history of video games. Among my favorites are
those made for all models of Nintendo Gameboy handhelds that were
manufactured before Gameboy Advance SP including.

## Hardware

One of the reasons is because these handhelds were made extremely well. I mean
really, really well. Every button press is very responsive, no sticky buttons,
no noise or crunch when buttons are pressed even after years of usage.
[Check out this Gameboy that
survived bombing during the
Gulf War](http://techcrunch.com/2007/01/03/blown-up-game-boy-from-the-gulf-war/).
Cannot be confident on whether that story is true or not but having personally
seen a totally working Gameboy after it was eventually dropped from 4th floor
and hit the asphalt driveway I have no doubt this is possible.

## Software

Another reason is that beyond great and popular video games released for Gameboy
handhelds there are many amazing rare games I constantly stumble upon till
these days. Here are some of them in alphabetical order:

The list goes on and on. Besides titles released by Nintendo there are
ones developed independently these days by individuals who only release
digital ROMs that can be downloaded and executed in an emulator. For instance,
check out this
[Flappy Bird game for Gameboy Advance](http://www.jayvanhutten.com/flappy/):

Now wouldn't it be great to be able to play license-free ROMs on real
hardware in addition to keeping all your Gameboy / Gameboy Color / Gameboy
Advance collection in one cartridge?

## EZ-Flash IV

Luckily, there is a solution I was happy to discover lately -
[EZ-Flash IV](http://www.ezflash.cn/).
It looks like a normal GBA cartridge. It is a very special cartridge however.
What it does is it reads Gameboy Advance games ROMs (files that, when
loaded into a console emulator, play a video game) from a microSD card (with up
to 32GB of capacity) just like any other GBA emulator would and runs games
right in bare Gameboy Advance with amazingly good performance. But please note
that it's still illegal to download ROMs from the Internet you don't have a license
for. Having a license means simply owning a physical copy of authentic game cartridge.
So please be responsible and read [legal information about ROMs and Emulation on official Nintendo
website](https://www.nintendo.com/corp/legal.jsp) before proceeding.

So, assuming you've read the legal information and are acknowledged about which ROMs are
good to download and which are not, here is my story with EZ-Flash IV.
I received mine from
[http://www.max-console.com/](http://www.max-console.com/). It works
very well so far. The only complaint I have is about the quality of cartridge
casing which is not compared to the quality of original Nintendo's cartridges
unfortunately. Besides, it's an amazing addition to my Gameboy collection. I keep
all my already owned GB/GBC/GBA games in EZ-Flash IV and can easily run
license-free ROMs on real hardware.

In order to run original Gameboy / Gameboy Color games on EZ-Flash IV,
they need to be emulated. I've accomplished that with
[Gameboy Emulator](http://www.webpersona.com/goomba/)
and [Gameboy Color Emulator](http://www.dwedit.org/gba/goombacolor.php).
Both emulators take GB/GBC ROMs and export GBA-compatible ROM. The good
thing about this is that you
can benefit from what the emulation provides you with, like for example
being able to save/load game progess state at at any given point.
Say, you're playing Super Mario Land (which is an amazing Gameboy title by the
way!) for
10 minutes and suddenly need to go to do some other things. By running game
off an original cartridge you'd have to drop all your progress by turning
the device off while
with Gameboy emulator on EZ-Flash IV you just save the state, turn Gameboy
Advance off and load your progess up next time you turn the device on.

Here is my <a href="https://vimeo.com/144437942">video recording of
EZ-Flash IV in action</a>:

## Closing thoughts

EZ-Flash IV is very convenient. I like it a lot. The only thing that makes
me worry about EZ-Flash IV and availability of GB/GBC/GBA ROMs online is
that it can make some people believe that there is
no need to own physical cartridges. Please note that it is still illegal
to download Nintendo ROMs from the Internet if you don't have a license for
them. Obtain a physical copy of a game before trying it out. Don't like the
game? Sell the cartridge on eBay. Like it? Keep it on shelf and play it
via EZ-Flash IV. Owning physical copies of your favorite titles and keeping
them on the shelf is actually a very satisfiying feeling. It also demonstrates
how serious you are about your little hobby :)
