title: Perfect rtorrent setup
---

So, I want to..:

* being able adding torrents to the queue
* limit number of concurrent active downloads
* categorize torrents easily
* being able setting seed max ratio and max seed time per torrent
* being able seeding torrents downloaded with other clients

..and all that should be extremely easy.
