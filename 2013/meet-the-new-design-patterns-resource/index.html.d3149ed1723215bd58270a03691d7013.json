Since I was not alone in my team who desired to really understand all the\nDesign Patterns, at some point we started an internal newsletter. We intended\nto discuss all the known patterns with practical examples together via daily\nnewsletter. At some point we realized that all the research we're doing should\nbe centralized somewhere in public domain and that we should really continue\nthis research publicly as it felt like the way to become good at desired\nsubject and collect a good documentation that could be useful for others to\nlearn from.</p>\n<h2 id=\"launched\"><a href=\"#launched\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>Launched</h2>\n<p>On 21st of February, 2013 we registered an\n<a href=\"https://github.com/designpatterns\">Github Organization</a> called\n<strong>designpatterns</strong> with one single repository where we've put our writings and\nexamples we've done till then. We feel like this was a beginning of a\npotentially great resource which will hopefully fill the gap between most\ndevelopers and Design Patterns. It will become better and better with time\nas we continously update it with new patterns and polish existing documentation\nand code examples. We realize how much work we have left to do before we can\ncall it a good resource but we're very excited about our journey to it and\nwe believe in what we do.</p>\n<p>Our repository is completely open for suggestions and pull requests. We invite\nyou to participate in it's development. We believe in open source and in\ncommunity-driven projects and our project is in the list.</p>\n<p>So, here is the link: <a href=\"https://github.com/designpatterns\">https://github.com/designpatterns</a></p>\n<h2 id=\"what-do-you-think\"><a href=\"#what-do-you-think\" class=\"phenomic-HeadingAnchor\">#</a>What do you think?</h2>\n<p>I would be glad to know what you think about it. Is it something you were\nmissing as well as us? Is there anything like that already you know about?\nLeave your comments below.</p>\n","__filename":"posts/2013-02-27-meet-the-new-design-patterns-resource.md","__url":"/2013/meet-the-new-design-patterns-resource/","__resourceUrl":"/2013/meet-the-new-design-patterns-resource/index.html","__dataUrl":"/2013/meet-the-new-design-patterns-resource/index.html.d3149ed1723215bd58270a03691d7013.json"}
