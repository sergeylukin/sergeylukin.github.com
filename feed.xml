Twitter, Github, PayPal, Reddit, etc. The blackout was a result of a global
DDoS attack on Dyn, the domain name service used by these sites.</p>
<p>In this post I'm going to talk about a way one could use to be able to access
these websites by their fully qualified domain names regardless of the fact that
their authoritative servers were not able to respond. Please note that although
the method applies to all major Operating Systems, I'm only discussing OS X here.</p>
<h2 id="etcresolvconf"><a href="#etcresolvconf" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>/etc/resolv.conf</h2>
<p>Before I dig into the details let me offer a little challenge for you that is
somewhat related to this topic.
Are you a sysadmin or a DevOps? If so then you
shouldn't have trouble answering following interview question, otherwise just
read on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A web application is lagging. One edit the <code>/etc/resolv.conf</code> and add this line
<code>nameserver 8.8.8.8</code>. It appear to fix the problem. Why?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I've seen this question on
<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-should-a-fullstack-developer-know-in-2016-1/answer/Christian-Baune">Christian Baune's list of fullstack developer
questions</a>
list.</p>
<p>I must admit, it puzzled me at first. The mysterious <code>8.8.8.8</code> just scared me
off until I performed a reverse DNS lookup using <code>host 8.8.8.8</code> which returned:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">8.8.8.8.in-addr.arpa domain name pointer google-public-dns-a.google.com.</code></pre>
<p>It turns out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Public_DNS">Google has a public DNS server that resolves domain names to IP
addresses</a>, how cool is that?
So basically a web application is lagging due to
some problems with DNS, which by itself can be pretty much anything, and we
can overcome those problems by resolving hosts via Google's public DNS server.
While <a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/811123/what-would-happen-if-someone-would-flush-host-from-google-public-dns-while-its">using Google's public DNS server doesn't mean we eliminiate domain
name resolving
problems</a>
, there is a big chance you will be able to resolve
any existing domain name through it and that's exactly what happened in the
hypothetical (or not?) scenario above.</p>
<h2 id="configure-dns-on-os-x"><a href="#configure-dns-on-os-x" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Configure DNS on OS X</h2>
<p>Now it's time for me to explain how one could use Google's public DNS server
in OS X and revert back to the original settings if so required.</p>
<p>There is a pre-installed tool called <code>networksetup</code>, here is a cut
from <code>man networksetup</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>networksetup -- configuration tool for network settings in System Preferences.
The networksetup command is used to configure network settings typically
configured in the System Preferences application. The
networksetup command requires at least "admin" privileges to run. Most of
the set commands require "root" privileges to run.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First, we'll use <code>networksetup</code> to list all the network services we have:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">networksetup listallnetworkservices</code></pre>
<p>The command above should produce an output similar to following:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">Wi-Fi
Bluetooth PAN
Thunderbolt Bridge</code></pre>
<p>Assuming we're using Wi-Fi service, we'd fetch it's current configuration
by running following command:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">networksetup -getdnsservers Wi-Fi</code></pre>
<p>There are two possible outputs here: either nothing is configured and the
output will look like so (scenario 1):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">There aren<span class="hljs-string">'t any DNS Servers set on Wi-Fi.</span></code></pre>
<p>...either we have something configured and the output may be similar to
following (scenario 2):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">10.0.1.1</code></pre>
<p>Just remember the output and we will get back to it when rolling back.</p>
<p>Let's overwrite the settings (you may need to enter admin password in the
dialog that will show up):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 8.8.8.8</code></pre>
<p>Now any domain name you try to visit via your browser should be resolved
using Google's public DNS server. That was pretty easy, wasn't it?</p>
<p>Later on when you need to roll back, just run the following command in
case you didn't have anything configured for the network service:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi Empty</code></pre>
<p>Or if you had something configured, say <code>10.0.1.1</code> then run:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">networksetup -setdnsservers Wi-Fi 10.0.1.1</code></pre>
<p>That's it! Thanks for reading. Happy domain names resolving :)</p>

Think of a table with rows.
Do you think that it's possible to only apply styles to first, let's
say 3, rows using CSS3 selector? Well, it turns out it is possible with
well known
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#nth-child-pseudo">:nth-child()</a> pseudo
class selector. Let's look at it's basic usage first.</p>
<h2 id="basics"><a href="#basics" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Basics</h2>
<p>Besides accepting <code>odd</code> or <code>even</code> as an argument value <code>:nth-child()</code>
accepts algebraic expression in format: <em>a</em>n+<em>b</em> and executes it in iteration
by incrementing <code>n</code> starting with <code>n = 0</code> until it reaches the end of the
elements tree or until the resulting value is zero or negative.</p>
<p>So, assuming following markup:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-html"><span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">ul</span>></span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">li</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"item"</span>></span>f<span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>></span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">li</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"item"</span>></span>o<span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>></span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">li</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"item"</span>></span>o<span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>></span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">li</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"item"</span>></span>b<span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>></span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">li</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"item"</span>></span>a<span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>></span>
  <span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">li</span> <span class="hljs-attr">class</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"item"</span>></span>r<span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>></span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">ul</span>></span></code></pre>
<p><code>.item:nth-child(2n+1)</code> will do something like:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>2 * 0 + 1</code> equals 1 and so first element will be selected</li>
<li><code>2 * 1 + 1</code> equals 3 and so third element will be selected</li>
<li><code>2 * 2 + 1</code> equals 5 and so fifth element will be selected</li>
<li><code>2 * 3 + 1</code> equals 7 and so selector will stop iterating as seventh element
doesn't exist (note that elements index start with <code>1</code> and not with <code>0</code>)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="now-the-real-stuff"><a href="#now-the-real-stuff" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Now the real stuff</h2>
<p>In the end of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#nth-child-pseudo">spec</a>,
there is this note:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value <em>a</em> can be negative, but only the positive values of <em>a</em>n+<em>b</em>, for n≥0,
may represent an element in the document tree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What this means is that if we pass <code>-1n+3</code> or shorter <code>-n+3</code> following
iteration will happen:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>-1 * 0 + 3</code> equals 3 and so third element will be selected</li>
<li><code>-1 * 1 + 3</code> equals 2 and so second element will be selected</li>
<li><code>-1 * 2 + 3</code> equals 1 and so first element will be selected</li>
<li><code>-1 * 3 + 3</code> equals 0 and so selector will stop as there is no element with
index <code>0</code></li>
</ol>
<p>..which results in selecting first 3 elements! Done.</p>
<p>By the way there is a <a href="http://nth-test.com/">online nth-child simulator</a> which I
personally use when playing with <code>nth-*</code> selectors. Just FYI.</p>

Apply styles just to paragraphs in
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catalan_language">Catalan</a> language
assuming following markup and of course solution shouldn't be
tightened to paragraphs exact position, order or depth:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-html"><span class="hljs-meta">&#x3C;!doctype html></span>

<span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">body</span>></span>
<span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">html</span>></span></code></pre>
<p>Before diving into the solving part let's refresh our minds on what is a
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/dirlang.html#h-8.1">lang</a> attribute:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>lang</code> attribute specifies the base language of an element's attribute values and
text content. The default value of this attribute is unknown.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Refer to
<a href="http://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php">ISO 639 Language Codes list</a> for valid values.</p>
<div class="session-post">
<p><strong>Tip</strong>: It's considered a good practice to set <code>lang</code> attribute in <code>&#x3C;html></code> tag, at least at least
(think of search engines, speech synthesizers etc.)</p>
</div>
<h2 id="first-guess"><a href="#first-guess" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>First Guess</h2>
<p>One possibly working option would be utilizing
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-selectors/#attribute-representation">attribute selector</a>
introduced in CSS2 which is
<a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-sel2">widely supported today</a>:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-attr">[lang="ca"]</span> <span class="hljs-selector-tag">p</span> {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">background-color</span>: yellow;
  <span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: red;
}</code></pre>
<p>..right? Well, not. This would apply the styles to all paragraphs including the one in English
which is not what we want.</p>
<h2 id="solution"><a href="#solution" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Solution</h2>
<p>What we really need here is a less known
<a href="http://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Selectors/pseudo-classes/:lang">:lang pseudo class</a>
selector which has even wider support among vendors than attribute selectors:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-css"><span class="hljs-selector-tag">p</span><span class="hljs-selector-pseudo">:lang(ca)</span> {
  <span class="hljs-attribute">background-color</span>: yellow;
  <span class="hljs-attribute">color</span>: red;
}</code></pre>
<p>What it actually does is it selects
elements that have inherited the specified language from their parents.
Because paragraph in English has two parents with <code>lang</code> attribute
(<code>&#x3C;article lang="en"></code>, <code>&#x3C;html lang="ca"></code>) and the closer one has
value of <code>en</code> it is out of our selector's scope.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While there most likely isn't much of need in styling elements based on their
locale it's definitely worth knowing the difference between using attribute
selector and :lang pseudo class when filtering locale-specific elements.</p>
<p>So if you find yourself using attribute selector to style locale-specific
content, I'd suggest to consider using <code>:lang</code> pseudo class selector instead.</p>
<p>Hopefully this post shows the difference between two approaches clearly
and demonstrates proper problem solving.</p>

support while there is different default version of Python on your system it's
important to note following caveats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pass <code>--with-python-config-dir</code> flag with the path to Python's <code>config</code>
directory</li>
<li>Remove <code>src/auto/config.cache</code> file if you've executed <code>./configure</code> before
without passing the <code>--with-python-config-dir</code> flag. This was the tip I
missed and spent an hour or two on failing to compile properly</li>
<li>Run <code>make clean</code> if you compiled VIM before and it didn't work out</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyways if in doubt here is the list of commands I had to execute in order to
successfully compile VIM with Python 2.7 support from scratch (make sure to
check your Python's config directory path and adjust accordingly):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> /usr/<span class="hljs-built_in">local</span>/src
wget ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/unix/vim-7.4.tar.bz2
tar -xjf vim-7.4.tar.bz2
<span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> vim74
./configure --prefix=/usr \
--<span class="hljs-built_in">enable</span>-pythoninterp \
--with-python-config-dir=/usr/<span class="hljs-built_in">local</span>/lib/python2.7/config
make &#x26;&#x26; make install</code></pre>
<div class="warning-box">
<p>Update on 19/11/2013</p>
<p>If all above fails, I'd consider opening <code>./src/auto/config.log</code>
file and verifying that configuration script fetches correct
version of Python by searching for <code>python</code> string. If it fetches wrong
version of Python then I'd replace the file it tries to fetch (for
example <code>/usr/bin/python2</code>) with my specific
version of Python binary just before running configuration script
(don't forget to remove <code>./src/auto/config.cache</code>) and rolling it back
after it finishes. A bit dumb method but it should work, please let
me know if you can think of any better approach.</p>

<p>Let's admit it, there were released many resources on Software Architectural
Patterns since
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns_%28book%29">Design Patterns</a> book was
published back in 1994 and still it requires a lot of effort to learn the
real nuts and bolts of all the patterns and even more effort is required to
understand the real difference between them and to realize how easy it is to
use wrong pattern.</p>
<h2 id="in-the-beginning"><a href="#in-the-beginning" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>In the beginning..</h2>
<p>Lately, I am much after learning Design Patterns and applying them in my daily
work. Since I was not alone in my team who desired to really understand all the
Design Patterns, at some point we started an internal newsletter. We intended
to discuss all the known patterns with practical examples together via daily
newsletter. At some point we realized that all the research we're doing should
be centralized somewhere in public domain and that we should really continue
this research publicly as it felt like the way to become good at desired
subject and collect a good documentation that could be useful for others to
learn from.</p>
<h2 id="launched"><a href="#launched" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Launched</h2>
<p>On 21st of February, 2013 we registered an
<a href="https://github.com/designpatterns">Github Organization</a> called
<strong>designpatterns</strong> with one single repository where we've put our writings and
examples we've done till then. We feel like this was a beginning of a
potentially great resource which will hopefully fill the gap between most
developers and Design Patterns. It will become better and better with time
as we continously update it with new patterns and polish existing documentation
and code examples. We realize how much work we have left to do before we can
call it a good resource but we're very excited about our journey to it and
we believe in what we do.</p>
<p>Our repository is completely open for suggestions and pull requests. We invite
you to participate in it's development. We believe in open source and in
community-driven projects and our project is in the list.</p>
<p>So, here is the link: <a href="https://github.com/designpatterns">https://github.com/designpatterns</a></p>

<pre><code class="hljs language-rhtml">&#x3C;%= <span class="hljs-keyword">render</span> @users %></code></pre>
<p>Today I want to show another tip I learned about
<a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html">ActiveRecord</a> from this
<a href="https://tutsplus.com/course/riding-ruby-on-rails/">tutsplus course</a> recorded
by José Mota.</p>
<h2 id="accessing-a-model-via-its-parent"><a href="#accessing-a-model-via-its-parent" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Accessing a model via it's parent</h2>
<p>Assuming we have 2 models with <code>has_many</code> and <code>belongs_to</code> relations
respectively:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-ruby"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">User</span> &#x3C; ActiveRecord::Base</span>
  has_many <span class="hljs-symbol">:posts</span>

<pre><code class="hljs language-ruby"><span class="hljs-class"><span class="hljs-keyword">class</span> <span class="hljs-title">Post</span> &#x3C; ActiveRecord::Base</span>
  belongs_to <span class="hljs-symbol">:user</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Now we want to list all posts written by User in a View. Here is what I did at
first myself.</p>
<p>Controller:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-ruby">@user   = User.find(params[<span class="hljs-symbol">:id</span>])
<span class="hljs-comment"># Find all posts by <span class="hljs-doctag">@user</span></span>
@posts  = Post.where(<span class="hljs-string">"user_id = ?"</span>, @user.id)</code></pre>
<p>View:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-rhtml"><span class="xml"></span>&#x3C;%<span class="ruby"> @posts.each <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> <span class="hljs-params">|post|</span> </span>%><span class="xml">
  <span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">p</span>></span></span>&#x3C;%=<span class="ruby"> post.title </span>%><span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">p</span>></span>
</span>&#x3C;%<span class="ruby"> <span class="hljs-keyword">end</span> </span>%><span class="xml"></span></code></pre>
<p>Did you already notice where I wrote too much? Well, of course in Controller.
Assigning User to <code>@user</code> was more than enough as our User model has <code>has_many</code>
relation with Post model and so posts can be accessed via <code>@user.posts</code> due to
magic provided by ActiveRecord.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a more expressive code that accomplishes exactly the same
result.</p>
<p>Controller:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-ruby">@user = User.find(params[<span class="hljs-symbol">:id</span>])</code></pre>
<p>View:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-rhtml"><span class="xml"></span>&#x3C;%<span class="ruby"> @user.posts.each <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> <span class="hljs-params">|post|</span> </span>%><span class="xml">

</span>&#x3C;%<span class="ruby"> <span class="hljs-keyword">end</span> </span>%><span class="xml"></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This is a clear example where most generic complexity can be be hidden
behind the scenes and only self-explanatory command executions operate the main
program logic. The importance of this aspect increases with codebase growth.</p>
<p>The more self-explanatory code we write, the less human-readable comments we
have to add.</p>

<p>Please note that there are alternative methods for installing software in
FreeBSD so you decide what method to use when installing those dependencies,
however following worked for me.</p>
<p>Install as <em>root</em> user:</p>
<p><strong>Git</strong>
<code>cd /usr/ports/devel/git &#x26;&#x26; make install clean</code></p>
<p><strong>PhantomJS</strong> (this may take a while)
<code>cd /usr/ports/lang/phantomjs &#x26;&#x26; make install clean</code></p>
<p><strong>NodeJS</strong>
<code>cd /usr/ports/www/node &#x26;&#x26; make install clean</code></p>
<p><strong>Npm</strong>
<code>cd /usr/ports/www/npm &#x26;&#x26; make install clean</code></p>
<p><strong>Google Chrome</strong> (this may take a while)
<code>cd /usr/ports/www/chromium &#x26;&#x26; make install clean</code></p>
<p><strong>libyaml</strong>
<code>cd /usr/ports/textproc/libyaml &#x26;&#x26; make install clean</code></p>
<p><strong>optipng</strong>
<code>cd /usr/ports/graphics/optipng &#x26;&#x26; make install clean</code></p>
<p>Install following as normal user:</p>
<p><strong>Rvm</strong> + <strong>Ruby</strong>
Refer to <a href="https://rvm.io/rvm/install/">https://rvm.io/rvm/install/</a> for
installation instructions</p>
<p><strong>Compass</strong>
<code>gem install compass</code></p>
<h2 id="verify-dependencies"><a href="#verify-dependencies" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Verify Dependencies</h2>
<p>Run <code>curl -L get.yeoman.io | bash</code> again to verify that you have completed
the list of required dependencies.</p>
<h2 id="say-hello-to-yeoman"><a href="#say-hello-to-yeoman" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Say hello to Yeoman</h2>

<h2 id="known-issues"><a href="#known-issues" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Known issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>When I first initialized a yeoman project and executed <code>yeoman server</code> I
got this scary error: <strong>v8::Context::New() V8 is no longer usable</strong>
The solution was to execute <code>yeoman build</code> at least once, since then I
didn't see this error</li>
<li>After a few files modifications yeoman couldn't reload the page (opened in
Opera) any more as there was this error: <strong>TypeError: Cannot call method 'send'
of null</strong> The solution was to use Chromium instead of Opera (didn't test
with Firefox however)</li>

<p>Being a PHP developer for more than 5 years I recently started learning
Ruby on Rails. While I'm used to <em>"Convention over Configuration"</em>
principles in PHP frameworks I found not a few conventions in Ruby on Rails
that amazed me in some way.</p>
<p>There is something that amazed me more than anything else and I couldn't
help myself from writing about it when I discovered it in
<a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book">this book</a>
written by Michael Hartl.</p>
<h2 id="render-a-partial-for-model-objects"><a href="#render-a-partial-for-model-objects" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Render a partial for model objects</h2>
<p>Assuming we have a simple Controller action:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-ruby"><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title">index</span></span>
  @users = User.all
<span class="hljs-keyword">end</span></code></pre>
<p>..and a simple partial template called <code>_user.html.erb</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-html"><span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">p</span>></span><span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">%=</span> <span class="hljs-attr">user.name</span> %></span><span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">p</span>></span></code></pre>
<p>..let's take a look at it's View (<code>index.html.erb</code>):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-rhtml"><span class="xml"></span>&#x3C;%<span class="ruby"> @users.each <span class="hljs-keyword">do</span> <span class="hljs-params">|u|</span> </span>%><span class="xml">
  </span>&#x3C;%=<span class="ruby"> render <span class="hljs-string">'user'</span>, <span class="hljs-symbol">user:</span> u </span>%><span class="xml">
</span>&#x3C;%<span class="ruby"> <span class="hljs-keyword">end</span> </span>%><span class="xml"></span></code></pre>
<p>Here, a partial <code>_user.html.erb</code> that resides in the same directory as
current template file is being rendered for every <code>@users</code> element.
Pretty straight-forward. Similarly I would do it in any PHP framework.</p>
<p>However as it turns out View's code can be replaced with just one line:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-rhtml">&#x3C;%= <span class="hljs-keyword">render</span> @users %></code></pre>
<p>It looks simple and logical at first sight, however, if you think about it,
there are so many things happening in this line.</p>
<p>Let's break it into pieces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rails infers that <code>@users</code> is a list of <code>User</code> objects.</li>
<li>Because <code>@users</code> is a list Rails iterates through every element.</li>
<li>Because <code>@users</code> consists of User objects it assigns every object
to partial's variable <code>user</code> and renders a partial called <code>_user.html.erb</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If <code>@users</code> would be a list of <code>Post</code> objects, Rails would
set partial's variable called <code>post</code> and render
a partial called <code>_post.html.erb</code> for every list element.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I'm a big fan of convention over configuration paradigm and such examples
excite me every time I discover them. I know it slows down the learning
progress in the beginning but it saves time in the long run.</p>

<p>This entry is part 1 of 3 in the <strong>Things I learned from personal website</strong> series:</p>
<ul>
<li>Part I, setup</li>
<li>Part II, seo (coming soon)</li>
<li>Part III, speed (coming soon)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2 id="preface"><a href="#preface" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Preface</h2>
<p>What can be better than creating a small personal website after years of
working with complex server-side driven systems. What I mean is that
when setting up a simple static website from scratch I had more chances to get
known with all the aspects of a well baked website without being diverted by
server-side issues.</p>
<p>In this entry I will share my experience with some nice tools and services I used
while setting up my personal website:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> to handle website generation</li>
<li><a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> format to write blog
posts</li>
<li><a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a> for commenting</li>
<li><a href="http://git-scm.com">Git</a> to keep track of changes and to deploy</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com">Github</a> to host the website</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with one of those tools, I highly recommend you checking them
out and in this entry I expect that you have done that alrady. After you completed
your basic setup use this article as a helper guide for more advanced customization.</p>
<h2 id="configuration"><a href="#configuration" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Configuration</h2>
<p>Jekyll reads configuration data from <code>_config.yml</code> file in site's root
directory.</p>
<p>You are not limited to options recognized by Jekyll. You can store any data
and retrieve it in any page/layout that contains
<a href="http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/">YAML</a> form matter block.
For example, I can store my personal info:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-yaml"><span class="hljs-attr">author:</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">  name:</span> <span class="hljs-string">Sergey</span> <span class="hljs-string">Lukin</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">  email:</span> <span class="hljs-string">contact@sergeylukin.com</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">  about:</span> <span class="hljs-string">About</span> <span class="hljs-string">me</span> <span class="hljs-string">text</span> <span class="hljs-string">goes</span> <span class="hljs-string">here</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">  profiles:</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">    - name:</span> <span class="hljs-string">Github</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">      url:</span> <span class="hljs-attr">https://github.com/sergeylukin</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">    - name:</span> <span class="hljs-string">Twitter</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">      url:</span> <span class="hljs-attr">https://twitter.com/sergey_lukin</span></code></pre>
<p>and retrieve it in a page using <a href="https://github.com/shopify/liquid/wiki">Liquid</a> syntax:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-html"><span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">p</span>></span>My name is {{ site.author.name }}<span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">p</span>></span>

<span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">p</span>></span>Social links:<span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">p</span>></span>
{% for profile in site.author.profiles %}
    <span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">a</span> <span class="hljs-attr">href</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"{{ profile.url }}"</span>></span>{{ profile.name }}<span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">a</span>></span>
{% endfor %}</code></pre>
<p>The key here is <strong>site</strong> object - in this case we use it to access variables
set in <code>_config.yml</code></p>
<h2 id="navigation"><a href="#navigation" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Navigation</h2>
<p>Navigation can be rendered by looping through <strong>site.pages</strong>.
Additionally, you can also set a variable, let's say, <strong>navigation</strong> in
every page you want to be in navigation menu and filter it in the loop. So,
here is the YAML front matter for a page that should show up in navigation:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-yaml"><span class="hljs-meta">---</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">title:</span> <span class="hljs-string">Page</span> <span class="hljs-string">title</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">navigation:</span> <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">---</span></code></pre>
<p>..then in navigation template loop over all pages and only print ones that have
<strong>navigation</strong> variable set to <strong>true</strong> (also we can check the URLs and add additional
markup if necessary):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-html"><span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">ul</span>></span>
  {% for node in site.pages %}
    {% if node.navigation == true %}
      {% assign attr = nil %}
      {% if page.url == node.url %}
        {% capture attr %}class="active"{% endcapture %}
      {% endif %}
      <span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">li</span>></span>
        <span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">a</span> <span class="hljs-attr">href</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"{{ node.url }}"</span>{{ <span class="hljs-attr">attr</span> }}></span>{{ node.title }}<span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">a</span>></span>
      <span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>></span>
    {% endif %}
  {% endfor %}
<span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">ul</span>></span></code></pre>
<p>In this example a comparison is done beween <strong>page.url</strong> and <strong>node.url</strong> and
if no difference found, then variable <strong>attr</strong> gets a value of <code>class="active"</code>
which allows us to apply special styles to menu item.</p>
<h2 id="list-posts"><a href="#list-posts" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>List posts</h2>
<p>Printing a list of items inside <code>_posts</code> directory is as easy as:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-html"><span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">ul</span>></span>
  {% for item in site.posts limit:5 %}
    <span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">li</span>></span>
      <span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">time</span> <span class="hljs-attr">datetime</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"{{ item.date | date: "</span>%<span class="hljs-attr">Y-</span>%<span class="hljs-attr">m-</span>%<span class="hljs-attr">d</span>" }}" <span class="hljs-attr">pubdate</span>></span>{{ item.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}<span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">time</span>></span>
      <span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">a</span> <span class="hljs-attr">href</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"{{ item.url }}"</span>></span>{{ item.title }}<span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">a</span>></span>
    <span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">li</span>></span>
  {% endfor %}
<span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">ul</span>></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="creating-a-new-post"><a href="#creating-a-new-post" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Creating a New Post</h2>
<p>To create a New Post I run
<a href="https://github.com/sergeylukin/sergeylukin.github.com/blob/master/_bin/newdraft">newdraft</a>
script:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">./_bin/newdraft HERE GOES POST TITLE</code></pre>
<h2 id="git-and-draft-posts"><a href="#git-and-draft-posts" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>GIT and Draft posts</h2>
<p>Usually it takes a while untill I finish writing a blog post. In the meanwhile I can
do changes to other parts of the website and I don't want GIT to recognize a
draft post as a new object. To avoid this I added following line in <code>.gitignore</code> file:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash">_posts/*.draft.*</code></pre>
<p>So that any file in <code>_posts</code> directory that ends with <strong>draft.md</strong> or
<strong>draft.markdown</strong> is ignored and only when I finish writing the post I remove
the <strong>draft</strong> from the filename.</p>
<h2 id="syntax-highlighting"><a href="#syntax-highlighting" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Syntax highlighting</h2>
<p>In almost every blog post of mine I insert code snippets so it's extremely
important to have syntax highlighting feature included. Jekyll uses Pygments
to handle this. Here is how I use it:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-html">{% highlight html %}
..some code here..
{% endhighlight %}</code></pre>
<p>Wonder how I succeeded to print Liquid syntax without it being parsed?
I placed it between <strong>{% raw %}</strong> and <strong>{% endraw %}</strong>
tags. For more Liquid stuff consider reading
<a href="https://github.com/shopify/liquid/wiki/liquid-for-designers">Liquid for Designers</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that Liquid v2.3.0 and higher supports tag <strong>{% raw %}</strong>
instead of <strong>{% literal %}</strong> as it was in v2.2.2.
Besides that, I would highly recommend installing locally Jekyll and Liquid of
exactly same versions as Github pages server is running (you can always check
what software they are running
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages">here</a>)
and generating a website locally before deploying. That way you will definitely
identify any potential problem as early as possible and it will save your time.</p>
<h2 id="commenting"><a href="#commenting" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Commenting</h2>
<p>My commenting platform of choice is <a href="http://disqus.com">Disqus</a>. After signing up
add a little bit of configuration to <code>_config.yml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-yaml"><span class="hljs-attr">disqus:</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">  enabled:</span> <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
<span class="hljs-attr">  shortname:</span> <span class="hljs-string">YOUR_DISQUS_SHORTNAME</span></code></pre>
<p>and insert this piece of HTML/JavaScript wherever you want to enable comments:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-javascript">{% <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> site.disqus.enabled %}
&#x3C;!-- Disqus -->
<span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">div</span> <span class="hljs-attr">id</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"disqus_thread"</span>></span><span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">div</span>></span></span>

  })();
<span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>></span></span>
{% endif %}</code></pre>
<p>Please note that you can place this code in a separate file, let's say <code>disqus.html</code>
inside <code>_includes</code> directory and only add one line wherever you want to include it:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-html">{% include disqus.html %}</code></pre>
<h2 id="twitter-button"><a href="#twitter-button" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Twitter button</h2>
<p>For official integration instructions refer to
<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/tweet-button">their documentation</a>.
As an option you can add following to <code>_config.yml</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-yaml"><span class="hljs-attr">like_button_twitter:</span> <span class="hljs-literal">true</span></code></pre>
<p>create <code>_includes/like_button_twitter.html</code> with following contents:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-javascript">{% <span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> site.like_button_twitter %}
&#x3C;!-- Tweet btn -->

<span class="xml"><span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;/<span class="hljs-name">script</span>></span></span>
{% endif %}</code></pre>
<p>and finally include it in template, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-html">{% include like_button_twitter.html %}</code></pre>
<h2 id="404-page"><a href="#404-page" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>404 Page</h2>
<p><a href="http://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a> service makes it extremely easy to set custom
404 page - just place, let's say, 404.md file in the root directory.
Also, I'm not huge fan of that, but I add index.md file to directories that
don't have index page (like /js/, /css/ etc.) and include content's of 404 page.
As long as I have those directories in the list of directories to ignore in robots.txt
file, it's not a big deal.</p>
<h2 id="faviconico"><a href="#faviconico" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>favicon.ico</h2>
<p>Don't forget to place <strong>favicon.ico</strong> file in the root directory. Don't have one?
Check out <a href="http://www.favicon.cc/">favicon.cc</a></p>
<p>Add meta tag in page's head:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-html"><span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">link</span> <span class="hljs-attr">rel</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"shortcut icon"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">href</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"/favicon.ico"</span> /></span></code></pre>
<h2 id="humanstxt"><a href="#humanstxt" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>humans.txt</h2>
<p>What is humans.txt?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's an initiative for knowing the people behind a website.
It's a TXT file that contains information about the different
people who have contributed to building the website.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why humans.txt?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because it's something simple and fast to create</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So why not:) Place it in the root directory of your website
with some message to humans and optionally add author tag
to the <code>&#x3C;head></code> tag:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-html"><span class="hljs-tag">&#x3C;<span class="hljs-name">link</span> <span class="hljs-attr">rel</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"author"</span> <span class="hljs-attr">href</span>=<span class="hljs-string">"/humans.txt"</span> /></span></code></pre>

<p>Recently I was challenged to integrate source code versioning and efficient
website deployment in a team that was not ready to switch from old-school FTP deployment.
I call it "lazy integration" because it is indeed full featured integration
while it doesn't force anyone in the team using GIT at all.</p>
<p>This post contains information on how I did it and aims to be a how-to reminder
for myself in case I will ever do this again. It works for me just fine but

<h2 id="overview"><a href="#overview" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Overview</h2>
<p>Let's take a brief look at what we're going to do and how things are going to work after
we finish.</p>
<p>First, a bare repository is initialized out of production source code directory, some hooks
are being installed and repo can now be cloned to dev stations.</p>
<p>Pushing modifications to bare repository activates a hook
(<a href="https://gist.github.com/3175467">pre-receive</a>) that checks for any
local working directory (production source code) changes against HEAD (latest commit).
If no changes were found it just quits with no error and another hook
(<a href="https://gist.github.com/3175502">post-receive</a>)
applies pushed commits to the working directory (production source code).
However, if any changes were detected they are submitted to a newly created commit and
hook quits with an error. At this point developer should bring that commit to
his cloned repo (by executing, let's say, PULL command) and PUSH once again.</p>
<p>What is so special in this flow? Well, it allows you to make changes directly on
PRODUCTION source code while still being able using GIT to track and deploy your
modifications. Some teams need just that but please make sure to read some of my thoughts
on that in the end of this post.</p>
<h2 id="get-started"><a href="#get-started" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Get started</h2>
<p>Let's get our hands dirty and try a real example.</p>
<p>Although I couldn't think of any software project that wouldn't fit this integration, I
expect you to make required adjustments for your specific scenario if you decided to apply this
integration to your project.</p>
<p>In our example we assume that we have a simple static website, it's
webroot path is <code>/var/htdocs/myproject</code> on PRODUCTION server (also we assume that
you have SSH access to this server).</p>
<p>Initialize a GIT repository out of source code we have in <code>myproject</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> /var/htdocs
mkdir myproject.git &#x26;&#x26; <span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> myproject.git
git init --bare
git --work-tree=../myproject add .
git --work-tree=../myproject commit -m<span class="hljs-string">'Initial commit'</span></code></pre>
<p>Setup hooks. First, download
<a href="https://gist.github.com/3175467">pre-receive</a> hook as
<code>/var/htdocs/myproject.git/hooks/pre-receive</code> and
make it executable:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> /var/htdocs/myproject.git/hooks
wget http://bit.ly/19l9tpg -O pre-receive --no-check-certificate
chmod +x pre-receive</code></pre>
<p>Next, download
<a href="https://gist.github.com/3175502">post-receive</a> hook
as <code>/var/htdocs/myproject.git/hooks/post-receive</code> and
make it executable:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> /var/htdocs/myproject.git/hooks
wget http://bit.ly/12XVJ57 -O post-receive --no-check-certificate
chmod +x post-receive</code></pre>
<p>Now open both of the hooks in your editor of choice and make sure that the value of <code>WORKTREE</code> variable
represents the absolute or relative path (relatively to <code>/var/htdocs/myproject.git/</code>)
of your source code directory.</p>
<p>You're ready to clone bare repository to your local dev station and PUSH from
it.</p>
<p>Additionally, you could set some restrictions on your bare repository (I find
them reasonable on PRODUCTION bare repository):</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-built_in">cd</span> /var/htdocs/myproject.git
git config receive.denyDeletes <span class="hljs-literal">true</span>
git config receive.denyNonFastForwards <span class="hljs-literal">true</span></code></pre>
<p><code>denyDeletes</code> set to <code>true</code> denies any attempts to delete a branch remotely.</p>
<p><code>denyNonFastForwards</code> set to <code>true</code> denies any attempts to delete/replace
existing commits remotely.</p>
<p><a name="deploy-tip"></a></p>
<h2 id="custom-deployment"><a href="#custom-deployment" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Custom deployment</h2>
<p>If updating working directory is not enough for your deployment needs I
suggest commiting a script which will do all is required and executing it
in <code>post-receive</code> hook right after working tree update, like so:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs language-bash"><span class="hljs-comment"># update the working tree</span>
GIT_WORK_TREE=<span class="hljs-variable">$WORKTREE</span> git checkout -f

<span class="hljs-comment"># run custom deploy script</span>
deploy_script=<span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-variable">$WORKTREE</span>/deploy.sh"</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">if</span> [ -e <span class="hljs-string">"<span class="hljs-variable">$deploy_script</span>"</span> ]
<span class="hljs-keyword">then</span>
  . <span class="hljs-variable">$deploy_script</span>
<span class="hljs-keyword">fi</span></code></pre>
<p>In this example I'm executing <code>deploy.sh</code> script which resides in the root of
my repository. Which means I can control my deployment right from my
local repo and any changes to script take place immediately. It's very
powerful.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a href="#conclusion" class="phenomic-HeadingAnchor">#</a>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Although I believe that any source code deployment should be done via VCS like
GIT I know that there are not few programmers out there who're not ready to
waste their time learning VCS and they feel themselves uncomfortable with the
fact that any PRODUCTION update should go through a "long" deployment process.</p>
<p>So, even though I'm glad I could find a solution for teams with weak workflow,
I highly recommend changing the workflow rather than using this kind of solution.</p>
<p>And what kind of deployment strategy are you using in your projects?</p>
